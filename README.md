# Spotify Lyrics API

This provides an unofficial API to fetch song lyrics from Spotify. It uses an undocumented internal endpoint, so use it at your own risk.

## Features

-   Fetches synchronized, color-coded lyrics.
-   Caches responses to JSON files to avoid repeated requests.
-   Built with FastAPI.

-   `market` (string, optional, default: "from_token"): The market to use for the request.
-   `vocal_removal` (boolean, optional, default: False): Whether to request lyrics with vocals removed.
